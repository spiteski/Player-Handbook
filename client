        <name type="string">Blood Hunter</name>
        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Blood Hunter</h><p>In a landscape tormented by all manner of beasts, devils. and abominations from beyond the veil. most live in fear of the dark, of superstition, and of the unknown.</p><p>Some grow hardened by this experience, instead choosing to stand up and fight against the tide of shadow. These folk are called 'heroes'.</p><p>Some, however, are so fanatical and bent on destroying the anethema that plagues the countryside that they embrace dark, forbidden knowledge. They sacrifice some of their own vital force in dubious, forgotten blood rituals to better understand their enemies. Their methods sometimes blur the line between themselves and the evils they hunt. calling their own humanity into question. These folk are called 'Blood Hunters'.</p><h>BECOME THE ENEMY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENEMY.</h><p>These warriors have chosen to merge the martial pursuit of deadly weapon play with elements of vicious blood magic to create impressively effective combat techniques. Their deep knowledge and unnatural connection with wicked creatures allows them an advantage in tracking, hunting, and destroying even the most resilient of abhorrent fiends. They surrender their own vitality to grant them insight into their foes, and the ability to manipulate them from the inside. Some brew crude, poisonous alchemical tonics from the harvested organs of felled monsters, mutating their blood and bodies to be even further in tune with their quarry, becoming something other than human themselves. Others go further, reaching out and making a pact with lesser dark entities in hopes of using their grim gifts against greater evils. Many blood hunters push too far for their goals, falling to their own hubris and becoming the monsters they've chosen to hunt. This is the greatest fear of a blood hunter, and of the societies at large that shun them.</p><h>ALMOST AS FEARED AS THEIR PREY</h><p>The nature of their abilities and training has bred many rumors across the lands. some of which aren't too far from the truth. Common folk consider them cursed, often turning them away at the door. Nobles see them as occasionally convenient, but a generally reviled nuisance. Mages find them useful allies if kept at arm's length, while pious clerics and paladins keep their distance with a watchful eye. To be a blood hunter is to accept a life of solitude until proven trustworthy and dependable.</p><table><tr decoration="underline"><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Proficiency Bonus</b></td><td><b>Crimson Rite Die</b></td><td><b>Features</b></td><td><b>Blood Curses Known</b></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>Hunter's Bane, Crimson Rite</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>fighting Style</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>Blood Hunter Order</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>1d6</td><td>Extra Attack</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>1d6</td><td>Blood Maledict (2/rest)2</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>1d6</td><td>Blood Hunter Order feature</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>1d6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>1d8</td><td>Grim Psychometry</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>1d8</td><td>Dark Velocity</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>1d8</td><td>Blood Hunter Order feature, Blood Maledict (3/rest)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>ld8</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>1d10</td><td>-</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>1d10</td><td>Hardened Soul</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>1d10</td><td>Blood Hunter Order feature</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>1d10</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>1d12</td><td>Blood Maledict (4/rest)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>1d12</td><td>Blood Hunter Order feature</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>1d12</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>1d12</td><td>Sanguine Mastery</td><td>5</td></tr></table><h>Creating a Blood Hunter</h><p>As you create your blood hunter, keep in mind how your character relates to society and why they have taken to a life of monster hunting. Do they wish to protect society and as such have paid the ultimate price? Do they have a family they wish to protect at all costs? Did they make a mistake that cost them greatly. and they wish to make amends for their folly? Or are they bent on vengeance for some past wound or loss that drove them to choose this dark warriors path?</p><p>While a blood hunter begins their journey alone. they also acknowledge the strength in numbers and the benefits of trusted companions. Many blood hunters keep allies to both ensure that they succeed at their hunts, and to keep a watchful eye to prevent them from losing touch with their humanity. A blood hunter without conviction is lost, and often an honest friend is enough to keep them from straying.</p><h>Quick Build</h><p>You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. first, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons, or ranged and finesse weapons. Make Wisdom your next highest if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical power. Choose a higher Constitution next if you wish to use Crimson Rite on multiple weapons or want to have extra hit points to burn on amplifying blood curses.</p><h>Class Features</h><p>As a blood hunter, you gain the following class features.</p><h>Hit Points</h><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d10 per blood hunter level</p><p><b>Hit Points At 1st Level:</b> 10 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><b>Hit Points At Higher Levels:</b> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1st.</p><h>Proficiencies</h><p><b>Armor:</b> Light Armor, Medium Armor</p><p><b>Weapons:</b> Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons</p><p><b>Tools:</b> Alchemist's Supplies</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Strength, Wisdom</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, Insight, Investigation, Survival</p><h>Equipment</h><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><list><li>(a) a martial weapon or (b) two simple weapons</li><li>(a) a light crossbow or (b) hand crossbow, and 20 bolts</li><li>(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail armor</li><li>an explorer's pack</li></list><h>Features</h><listlink><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.hunter_sbane1@Blood Hunter">Hunter's Bane</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.crimsonrite1@Blood Hunter">Crimson Rite</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.fightingstyle2@Blood Hunter">Fighting Style</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.bloodhunterorder3@Blood Hunter">Blood Hunter Order</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.abilityscoreimprovement4@Blood Hunter">Ability Score Improvement</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.extraattack5@Blood Hunter">Extra Attack</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.bloodmaledict6@Blood Hunter">Blood Maledict</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.grimpsychometry9@Blood Hunter">Grim Psychometry</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.darkvelocity10@Blood Hunter">Dark Velocity</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.hardenedsoul14@Blood Hunter">Hardened Soul</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.sanguinemastery20@Blood Hunter">Sanguine Mastery</link></listlink><h>Blood Hunter Orders</h><listlink><link class="reference_classability" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.abilities.orderoftheghostslayer@Blood Hunter">Order of the Ghostslayer</link><link class="reference_classability" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.abilities.orderoftheprofanesoul@Blood Hunter">Order of the Profane Soul</link><link class="reference_classability" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.abilities.orderofthemutant@Blood Hunter">Order of the Mutant</link><link class="reference_classability" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.abilities.orderofthelycan@Blood Hunter">Order of the Lycan</link></listlink></text>

Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wild beast. Those that shun the curse spend their lives burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impulse. Those that embrace the dark nature of their curse learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament that drives the beast within.</p><p>The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo " The Taming", a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one's own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order's blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.</p><h>Features</h><listlink><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.heightenedsenses3@Blood Hunter">Heightened Senses</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.hybridtransformation3@Blood Hunter">Hybrid Transformation</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.advancedtransformation11@Blood Hunter">Advanced Transformation</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.ironvolition15@Blood Hunter">Iron Volition</link><link class="reference_classfeature" recordname="reference.classdata.bloodhunter.features.hybridtransformationmastery18@Blood Hunter">Hybrid Transformation Mastery</link></listlink></text>
